GenerialPluginSys is a non specialzed Class to scan folders for assemblies and load them info their
own app domain.  This generialied version is adapated from version 1.0 of notebook's plugin system.


To Write For it:

Add A reference to the project in your code.

Make a child class of the Instanced_PluginContainer contained within GeneralPluginSys.
Define GeneralPlugSys<YourSubclass> somewhere in your code.
It is recommanded, although not required to export wrappers routines that wrap the dynamiclly loaded
class functions you wish to call.



The Instanced_PluginContainer defines the bare minumumn GeneralPluginSys() needs. The defined variables should
remain public. Should you wish to change the underlying implementation without messing with the code, export some properties that match them.
